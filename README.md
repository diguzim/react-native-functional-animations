Here there are some simple examples regarding Animations on Functional components. We will be using hooks to manage the state transitions.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```
or
```bash
npm i

## Running this example

In order to run you need to have a simulator or device. This was only tested with a android simulator.

To get the app installed in a android simulator you need to run:

```bash
react-native run-android
```

This should install the app into your android device/simulator and run the javascript development server.
